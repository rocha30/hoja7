En the woman's house, the dog plays while she finishes her homework. 
The book she was reading and the computer on the table witness her concentration. 
Suddenly, the phone rings and, with the key in hand, the woman gets up to answer. 
Yes, it's her friend from the town, inviting her out. 
Without hesitation, she sets her homework aside and gets ready for an afternoon of fun.
